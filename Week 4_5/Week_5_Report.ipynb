    "# Capstone: Find the best neighborhood in Toronto to open a Restaurant Supply Store\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of mine who runs a leading Restaurant Supply Store has found out that I am studying data science and has asked for help in trying to determine which neighborhood in Toronto he should open his new store in.<br>\n",
    "Example Company:<br>\n",
    "http://www.bramainc.com/about-brama <br>\n",
    "I begin with an interview with my friend to determine the requirements.<br>\n",
    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which neighborhood should my friend open his new Restaurant Supply store in Toronto? <br>\n",
    "He wants to ensure steady and sustainable business.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements: \n",
    "### 1. Store needs to be strategically located inside the biggest concentration of restaurants in Toronto area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Confirm any assumption by means of modeling and testing the data. Specifically, visually cluster common restaurants in Toronto by neighborhood.\n",
    "### 3. Additionally determine that a good number people can frequent these restaurants with sustainable frequency inside these neighborhoods. \n",
    "    a.) Is the neighborhood populous?\n",
    "    b.) Is the neighborhood average salary close to the Canadian National Average?\n",
    "    \n",
    "My friend wants to be able to judge which neighborhoods also may be poised to grow in restaurant numbers in coming years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locating his new store according to these requirements will ensure the following: \n",
    "- lowest cost for delivery \n",
    "- shortest travel time to his store for his clients\n",
    "- overall lower run costs \n",
    "- increase in overall business\n",
    "- overall greater customer satisfaction \n",

    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of hard work went into creating the working data set.<br>\n",
    "I had to combine the following disparate data sources. The order of events went like this\n",

    "\n",
    "http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data<br>\n",

    "Use Pandas to grab the csv<br>\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 Merge Toronto Neighbourhood populations data with Toronto Postal Code data\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I joined population data to the Toronto Data.<br>\n",
    "#### 1.3 Toronto neighborhoods average after tax income broken down by postal code\n",

    "Next, I joined income data to the Toronto Data.<br>\n",
    "At this time I also saved a copy of the data set as my friend had asked for it in his list of requirements.<br>\n",

    "https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180313/dq180313a-eng.htm<br>\n",
    "Canadian families and unattached individuals had a median after-tax income of $57,000 in 2016.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Key Observation: Of the 103 Toronto Neighborhoods gathered only 55.3% or 57 Neighborhoods are above the median after-tax income. 37.8% or 39 Neighborhoods are below he median after-tax income. 6.7% or 7 neighborhoods did not register as it appears their populations are too low. It appears that the greatest concentration of affluence is near central Toronto. We decided to keep all neighborhoods in the dataset regardless of income of population as the majority were close enough. ***\n",

    "- which neighborhoods in Toronto have clusters of like Restaurants\n",
    "- how populated each neighborhoods is\n",
    "- the average after tax income is all of these neighborhoods\n",
    "- which neighborhood should he target to open his new store.\n"

    "A backgrounder on K-Means clustering <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "“We can use Silhouette analysis to evaluate each model. A Silhouette coefficient is calculated for observation, which is then averaged to determine the Silhouette score. <br>\n",
    "The coefficient combines the average within-cluster distance with average nearest-cluster distance to assign a value between -1 and 1. A value below zero  <br>denotes that the observation is probably in the wrong cluster and a value closer to 1 denotes that the observation is a great fit for the cluster and  <br>clearly separated from other clusters. This coefficient essentially measures how close an observation is to neighboring clusters, where it is desirable <br> to be the maximum distance possible from neighboring clusters. <br>\n",
    "We can automatically determine the best number of clusters, k, by selecting the model which yields the highest Silhouette score.” <br>\n",

    "As we built our list of neighborhoods with Restaurant venues exclusively we discovered most neighborhoods were similar and the greatest concentration of restaurants was in Central Toronto and downtown Toronto. This might seem obvious but it would also appear that these are some of the most affluent neighborhoods in Toronto so there appears to be correlation. By Locating in the general vicinity of the Exact location my friend could be geographically centered in this cluster and poised to service his restaurant customer base with greatest efficiency.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we built our our K-Means dataset we used Silhouette analysis to tell us there was a lot of similarity between neighborhoods and the most common restaurants contained with in. Really there was only 2 types of cluster or neighborhoods in greater Toronto. The vast majority of those were in 1 cluster. So Toronto restaurants might be many but they are very homogeneously located near the center of Toronto.<br>\n",
